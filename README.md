In this demo demonstration you must input `admin` for username and `0000` for password to continue with the program. This is due since we were not able to properly implement a user sign up; therefore, the username and login were left hardcoded.
Proceeding with `Login` you will be able to browse the database with forward and back buttons to cycle workout gruops on the top header, 
and to explore each exercise for instructions you are able to tap on them for more info.

And for increased customization you are able to change your `profile` by pressing the user icon at the bottom  right of the screen to navigate to the `profile` view.
Once in the `profile` view you can change your information by tapping the gear icon in the top right which would lead you to the `setup` screen.

And once you have your information in place, you are free to press the back button in the top left to return to the `profile` view and once there to access the `database` again you can press the `database` icon in the bottom left to browse once again.

Have a fun time exploring this application!
